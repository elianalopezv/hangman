# Hangman!

A classic game.
This is a 2D game made in less than **one day!** This was made as a technical assessment to enter to a company.
However, the result was a complete hangman with random english words and, believe it or not, it can be very addictive.

## 1. How does this Hangman look?

First, we will see the main screen. We can start inmediately or maybe remember how to play.

You can choose your level. Do you feel lucky? Let's play easy mode.
However, the level of difficulty only depends on the length of the words. The more difficult, the longer they will be.

Cool! Just start typing or clicking on the letters. It depends on you that the man survive and have a good time.
